# Filesystem Explorer

Filesystem Explorer is a command line program that lets you traverse your
computer's filesystem as if it was an old-school text adventure game.
Directories are rooms in a dungeon, and files are objects in the rooms.

Many people don't understand file system hierarchies, and I was trying to think
about how I understand the concept. This is pretty close to it. The computer is
a place, and the filesystem is like a map of that place.

This is a work in progress, and just for fun. Enjoy!
